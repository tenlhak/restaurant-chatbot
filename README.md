## 🌟 The Problem

We've all been there:

- Waiting on hold for 10 minutes to make a dinner reservation
- Struggling to hear the host over the restaurant's background noise
- Getting cut off mid-conversation and having to call back
- Playing phone tag just to modify a booking
- Miscommunications about party size or special requests
- Forgetting to ask about dietary accommodations

Restaurant staff face their own challenges:
- Managing multiple phone lines during peak hours
- Accurately recording reservation details while serving in-person customers
- Dealing with no-shows and last-minute cancellations
